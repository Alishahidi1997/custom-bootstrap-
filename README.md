First of all, install webpack version:

```
npm -g install webpack@3.3.0
```

Inside your project you need to install the following dependencies, remember to append the `--save` flag if you want them to be written to your `package.json`:

```
npm install css-loader node-sass sass-loader webpack@3.3.0
```
then install  'extract-text-webpack-plugin':
```
npm install extract-text-webpack-plugin
```
